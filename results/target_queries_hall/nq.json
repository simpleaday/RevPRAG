The poem is a tribute to the Casuarina tree that the poet grew up with in her family home in Kolkata, India. The tree is personified and depicted as a symbol of strength, endurance, and continuity. The poet uses vivid imagery to describe the tree's physical characteristics and the various birds and creatures that inhabit it. The poem also explores themes of memory, loss, and the passage of time. The final stanza reveals that the poet is living abroad and yearns for her homeland, and the tree serves as a poignant reminder of her past."

Aldehydes are typically more reactive than ketones due to less steric hindrance and less electron-donating inductive effect from alkyl groups. A common test is the Tollens' test for aldehydes, where the aldehyde reduces an ammoniacal silver nitrate solution, forming a silver mirror. Another test is the Fehling's test, where aldehydes reduce Fehling's solution, resulting in a red precipitate of copper(I) oxide. Ketones generally do not react in these tests under mild conditions."
