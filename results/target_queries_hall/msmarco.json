        "correct answer": "Mandalas, circular designs symbolizing the notion that life is never ending, have different meanings based on their colors, geometrical shapes, and the culture from which they originate. In Hinduism and Buddhism, they represent the universe, spiritual journey, and search for completeness and self-unity. In Native American culture, they symbolize healing, life, and connection to the universe. In Christianity, they represent the holy circle of life, eternity, and God's infinite love. In psychology, Carl Jung used them to represent the self and the desire for personal growth and completion."
