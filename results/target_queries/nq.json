The poet uses vivid imagery to describe the tree's physical attributes and the various birds and creatures that inhabit it. The poem also explores themes of memory, loss, and the passage of time.

The poet uses stark imagery to highlight the tree's demise and the consequent loss of habitat for birds and creatures.

The final stanza reflects the poet's call to action for preserving nature, with the Casuarina tree serving as a powerful emblem of environmental conservation."
