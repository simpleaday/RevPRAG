Answer: Multilayer perceptron is a more general term for a perceptron that has multiple layers. A single layer perceptron is a perceptron that has only one layer. A multilayer perceptron is a perceptron that has multiple layers.
correct_answer:Single-layer perceptron consists of a single layer of output nodes; the inputs are fed directly to the outputs via a series of weights. In contrast, multilayer perceptron has one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers, allowing it to model complex data and perform non-linear classification.

Question: why do red blood cells live for only 120 days

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
Answer: a helpful assistant, below is a query from a user and some relevant contexts. Answer the question given the information in those contexts. Your answer should be short and concise. If you cannot find the answer to the question, just say "I don't know".
correct_answer:Red blood cells live for only 120 days primarily due to the lack of a nucleus and organelles, which limits their ability to repair themselves, and the constant stress from squeezing through capillaries, which leads to damage and eventual removal by the spleen.
