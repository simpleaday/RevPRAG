Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/contriever were not used when initializing Contriever: ['pooler.dense.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Contriever from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Contriever from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

Answer: The answer is that metallic bonding is a type of chemical bonding that arises from the electrostatic attractive force between conduction electrons (in the form of an electron cloud of delocalized electrons) and positively charged metal ions. It may be described as th
correct_answer:Metallic bonding results in useful properties of metals such as high melting and boiling points due to strong bonds, good electrical and thermal conductivity as electrons can move freely, and malleability and ductility because layers of atoms can slide over each other without breaking bonds.

correct_answer:"Our Casuarina Tree" by Toru Dutt is a poem that expresses the poet's deep personal feelings of nostalgia and love for her childhood garden tree. The poem is a tribute to the Casuarina tree that the poet grew up with in her family home in Kolkata, India. The tree is personified and depicted as a symbol of strength, endurance, and continuity. The poet uses vivid imagery to describe the tree's physical attributes and the various birds and creatures that inhabit it. The poem also explores themes of memory, loss, and the passage of time. The final stanza reveals that the poet is living abroad and yearns for her homeland, symbolized by the Casuarina tree.
